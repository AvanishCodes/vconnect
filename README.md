> ## VConnect: connects volunteers anonymously to the clinical trials.

>> Every year many people die because of the disease for which there is no cure available, and the reason is, we cannot infect new people to get a cure. We seek to help all of them by giving them a chance to help the medical studies by participating in clinical trials and contribute their bit for the better of humanity. This platform does not allow the information of the users to be exposed to the clinical trial organizations till before they actually needto contact them for physical confirmation.

### The users have the functionality to 
> - Check the current clinical trials going around based on <b>Age</b>, <b>Gender</b>, <b>City</b>, <b>State</b> or country.
> - submit primary application to the organization to participate in the trial without submitting the name, email, any social profile or address.
> - Accept or reject the invitation of an organization after primary screenign
